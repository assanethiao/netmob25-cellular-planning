# netmob25-cellular-planning
Cellular network planning using Netmob25 mobility model with NS-3
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on cellular network planning in an urban environment, taking into account realistic user mobility patterns generated by the Netmob25 mobility model and simulated using NS-3.


The objective is to:

Simulate a population of mobile users moving inside a city

Define traffic assumptions for these users

Deploy and configure cellular base stations (eNB / gNB)

Evaluate network performance under realistic mobility conditions

Optimize infrastructure planning based on simulation results

This project combines:

Mobility modeling

LTE/5G simulation

Network performance analysis

Engineering-based infrastructure planning


🎯 Objectives

Generate realistic user mobility using Netmob25.

Integrate mobility traces into NS-3.

Deploy a cellular network infrastructure.

Simulate traffic demand.

Evaluate key performance indicators (KPIs).

Optimize number and placement of base stations.


🧠 Background
🔹 Cellular Network Planning

Cellular planning involves deciding:

Number of base stations

Their geographic position

Transmission power

Frequency bandwidth

Network configuration

The planning must consider:

User density

Mobility patterns

Traffic demand

Interference

Coverage constraints


🔹 Netmob25 Mobility Model

Netmob25 is a realistic urban mobility model based on datasets from the Netmob Data Challenge.

Unlike simple mobility models (Random Walk, Random Waypoint), Netmob25 reproduces:

Daily commuting patterns

Urban hotspots

Peak hours

Spatial clustering

Realistic speed distributions

It generates time-based mobility traces:

user_id | time | x | y | speed


These traces are imported into NS-3 to move user nodes.


🔹 NS-3 Network Simulator

NS-3 is a discrete-event network simulator used for research and engineering.

In this project, NS-3 is used to:

Simulate LTE/5G cellular networks

Model radio propagation

Perform handovers

Simulate TCP/UDP traffic

Measure performance metrics
